# Computer Graphics - Interactive Scale Model of the Solar System
This repository contains a Solar System developed in Three.js. My project provides dynamic and informative interaction with the Solar System, respecting real scales and distances between objects. In addition, it includes three unique GLTF "interiors," one for Earth, another for the Moon, and one for Mars.
